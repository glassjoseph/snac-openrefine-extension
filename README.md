# Snac Openrefine Extension
The SNAC OpenRefine extension allows SNAC edits to be made via OpenRefine.

### Documentation
The [SNAC OpenRefine Extension Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HjhKHAWXe6Xkh8F-qBnsl-psyaPd2UPBLX2OgaVbA2Q/edit?usp=sharing) details how to use the extension to make batch edits data in SNAC.

### Installation
More complete instructions for installing OpenRefine Extensions can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing/#installing-extensions).

To install this extension,
1. Download the extension from the [latest release](https://github.com/snac-cooperative/snac-openrefine-extension/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip contents into OpenRefine's extensions directory.  You may have to create the `extensions` directory if it does not already exist in your workspace (see below).  If you already have the snac extension, you should delete the original before unzipping.
3. Start (or restart) OpenRefine.

### Finding Workspace directory
You can find your OpenRefine workspace directory by going to the OpenRefine Home screen and clicking "Browse workspace directory".

Here is where that directory can normally be found.

Mac:  `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRefine/`

Linux:  `~/.local/share/openrefine/`

Windows: Depending on your version of Windows, your workspace may be in one of these directories:
```
%appdata%\OpenRefine
%localappdata%\OpenRefine
C:\Documents and Settings\(user id)\Local Settings\Application Data\OpenRefine
C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Roaming\OpenRefine
C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Local\OpenRefine
C:\Users\(user id)\OpenRefine
```

### Updating
To update the SNAC extension, simply download the latest release of this zip file and reinstall the extension.
