# snac-openrefine-extension
The SNAC OpenRefine extension allows SNAC edits to be made via OpenRefine.

### Installation
To install this extension,
1. Download the extension (usually as a zip file from GitHub)
2. Extract the zip contents into OpenRefine's “extensions” directory, making sure all the contents go into one folder with the name of the extension. You may have to create the "extensions" folder if it does not already exist in your workspace.
3. Start (or restart) OpenRefine.

### Finding Workspace directory
You can find your OpenRefine workspace dirctory by going to the OpenRefine Home screen and clicking "Browse workspace directory".

Here is where that directory can normally be found.

Mac:  `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRefine/`

Linux:  `~/.local/share/openrefine/`

Windows: Depending on your version of Windows, your workspace may be in one of these directories:
```
%appdata%\OpenRefine

C:\Documents and Settings\(user id)\Local Settings\Application Data\OpenRefine
C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Roaming\OpenRefine
